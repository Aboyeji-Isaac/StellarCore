# Changelog

All notable changes to StellarCore are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Entries start under `Unreleased` and move into a dated release when that release
ships. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#changelog) for how to add an entry
with your pull request.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Non-destructive invalidation and supersession for rate observations (#121):
  append-only, database-immutable disposition events with a reviewed state
  machine (quarantine, release, invalidate, supersede), bounded reason codes,
  and required review references. Adds a dry-run-by-default operator CLI and
  protected workflow. Latest-rate reads, the public rates API, reputation
  evidence, and a new observation timeline read model report blocked evidence
  as an explicit gap and never promote an older observation. Original
  snapshots are never modified. See
  [docs/rate-observation-dispositions.md](docs/rate-observation-dispositions.md).
