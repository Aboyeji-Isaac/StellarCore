/**

 * responsibility, so transitions are deterministic across process restarts
 * and horizontal execution.
 *
 * Transition policy (docs/anchor-health-policy.md):
 *
 * - SUCCESS evidence increments the consecutive-success counter and resets
 *   the failure counters. Recovery from DOWN or DEGRADED requires
 *   ANCHOR_RECOVERY_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD consecutive successes; the first
 *   success publishes DEGRADED. A first-ever success for an anchor with no
 *   established history publishes LIVE directly.
 * - A LIVE anchor degrades only after ANCHOR_TRANSIENT_DEGRADED_THRESHOLD
 *   consecutive transient failures, and goes DOWN only after
 *   ANCHOR_TRANSIENT_DOWN_THRESHOLD consecutive failures (or immediately when
 *   the first failure already spans the sustained window). One transient
 *   timeout therefore never publishes DOWN or DEGRADED.
 * - DETERMINISTIC configuration/protocol failures reach DOWN after
 *   ANCHOR_DETERMINISTIC_DOWN_THRESHOLD consecutive failures because retrying
 *   cannot fix them.
 * - UNKNOWN-class failures follow the transient path: they must never
 *   escalate faster than classified evidence.
 * - An anchor already DOWN stays DOWN on further failures; only recovery
 *   evidence changes its status.
 * - An anchor with no established history (UNKNOWN) never publishes DEGRADED
 *   from failures alone; it requires the full DOWN threshold.
